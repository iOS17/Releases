Features
User interface and system features
Interactive widgets
The widgets are now interactive, on the Home and Lock screens: for example, users can turn on the lights or shutters of the house by pressing the corresponding button of the Home widget or complete the tasks from the reminders by pressing directly on the list located in the widget, etc.

Wallpaper improvements
The brightness of the wallpaper image changes depending on the dark or light mode. Resized photos are automatically extended to the top with a gradient that fills the missing space. Live Photos are now also supported. The font weight for the text on the lock screen can be adjusted more freely.

Standby mode
Standby mode is automatically enabled when the phone is charging horizontally oriented and consists of displaying information on the screen via widgets in intelligent stacks and Live activities. The appearance of this information changes according to the ambient light, so for example at night they appear with less flashy and less bright colors so as not to disturb.

Home improvements
Users can cancel the move operation of a Widget or an app by shaking the phone.

Autocorrect and text prediction improvements
The keyboard's autocorrection and dictation are powered by a new on-device transformer model, which Apple says is more accurate and personalized to users' writing styles. Unlike previous versions of iOS, it can learn not to autocorrect swear words.[9][10] Autocorrected words are underlined, and can be reverted with a tap. Word predictions are shown inline, and added when the spacebar is tapped.[11]

AirDrop improvements
AirDrop file transfers continue over the Internet if devices become out of reach.
NameDrop: by tapping an iPhone or Apple Watch against another, users can start a file transfer, a shared activity with SharePlay, or exchange a customizable contact card.[12]
Spotlight improvements
The global search now allows users to change system settings directly from the search results. For example, if the user search for the word "wifi" from the Home, the switch to turn the Wi-Fi off or on appears directly in the search results.

Focus mode improvements
Silence Notifications: a new option for notifications in focus mode that allows users to choose to mute notifications Always or When blocked.

Visual Lookup improvements
Visual Lookup is now able to recognize in photos the symbols of the various lights in the car, the symbols in the labels of clothes, etc.

Siri improvements
Users can now simply say "Siri" instead of "Hey Siri" to activate Siri with their voice. Subsequent questions asked to Siri do not require the user to re-say the "Siri" command.
Users can now say "Hey Siri send a message" and then choose the application to use through a drop-down menu. After the first change, Siri will remember the choice and speed up the operation.
Users can ask Siri to read a page in Safari.
Ability to find a lost Apple TV remote with Siri.
Faster Haptic Touch
In the Haptic Touch duration settings there's a new 3rd duration that is even shorter than the other two available on iOS 16.

Advanced AutoFill in PDFs and scanned documents
The information saved by the user in Contacts can be used to automatically and securely fill in the fields of a form of a PDF or scanned document.

Accessibility improvements
Personal Voice uses machine learning to let users recreate their own voice as a text-to-speech model.[13]
Using Point and speak, the phone will read what is written on the push-button panels of household appliances.
Assistive Access: it's an extremely simplified iOS user interface that can be activated from the Accessibility settings, useful for people with cognitive disabilities.
Networking improvements
Private 5G and LTE networks: iOS 17 adds support for private cellular networks, allowing to connect an iPhone to a private 5G or LTE cellular network, using an eSIM or physical SIM that has been specifically provisioned for that network.[14]
A new setting for cellular networks allows users to disable cellular data usage statistics if they do not care which apps are consuming data.
iPhone Storage improvements
iPhone Storage now shows the space occupied by data shared between multiple apps from the same manufacturer.
